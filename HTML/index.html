		  <h4 align="justify">The Internet provides the opportunity for investors to post online opinions that they share with fellow investors. The analysis of these online opinion posts can facilitate both investors’ investment decision making and stock companies’ risk perception. This project develops a novel ontology to conduct analysis of online opinion posts in stock market using Support Vector Mechines. Here we integrate support vector machine and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity modeling. The posts and reviews of various companies were taken from various websites. Empirical results suggest solid correlations between stock price volatility trends and stock forum sentiment. Results also imply that investor views has a particularly strong effect for value stocks relative to growth stocks.</h4>

			<p align="justify" class="style3">INVESTORS have often found it very costly to acquire useful information to assist them in investment decision making. For example, many investors have devoted a great deal of time to read messages posted on internet stock message boards to estimate asset prices based on information of varying quality. It has been reported that these message boards can have a significant impact on financial markets. Efficient investment decision making today is based on a variety of information sources including historical financial data series and messages posted on stock message boards. There have been a number of studies showing that the sentiment contained in these messages has been correlated with stock prices.</p>
